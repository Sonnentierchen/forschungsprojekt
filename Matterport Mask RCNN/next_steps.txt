Goal:

* Mask branch cut off [not so important]
	* Not created on model creation
	* Weights not loaded

* Model can be used for inference on whole video [important]
	* Each frame processed
	* Detection data can be stored in vatic or coco format

* Model retrainable [important]
	* Analyze how to train specific layers
	* Analyze how to cut-off the last layer and retrain primarily that one
		* Find out how to skip loading weights for certain layers
		* Find out where the last layer is created
		* Find out how to create one only using certain classes
	* Groundtruth data in vatic or coco format can be used
	* Make training possible from command line
		* For given set of groundtruth data
		* Provide laerning rate
